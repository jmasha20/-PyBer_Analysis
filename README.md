## Summary
Based on the results, this analysis provides three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing access and disparities among city types:

1. The majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities, however, drivers average $11 less. PyBer can find ways to reward drivers to close the earning gap across city types. 
2. On the other hand, the costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities. Potential and current ridership may be discouraged from using PyBer given the high average fare per ride. To address this issue of access, PyBer could lower the cost per mile and adding a share ride feature, allowing riders to share cost along the pickup and destination route. 
3. Given rides are significantly less in rural and suburban cities it is suggested these findings be further explored. PyBer could consider a rider survey to determine transportation needs and familiarity with PyBer's ridesharing services. The survey data can be used to design a stragetic marketing plan to reach rural and suburban neighborhoods.
